# INCG v0.1

 INCG v0.1
 A library of essential tools for computational geometry
 Copyright 2017-2022 Ioannis Nompelis

This is the growing collection of my tools for performing calculations that
involve geometry in multiple dimensions. It is meant to be a very lean, fast
and portable library with a very simple API in C/C++ and Fortran.

The library will be receiving updates as I keep revisiting my tools and as I
build new ones in the order that I need them in my work.

Documentation with Doxygen will be included in future updates.

Added support for a "mesh" object that is made of triangles. Presently, only
a uniform mesh refinement method is included, and other methods of refinement
will be added.

Added a function to generate a random point inside a triangle.

Added some C++ code to juggle surface type meshes.
