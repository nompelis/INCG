 INCG v0.1
 A library of essential tools for computational geometry
 Copyright 2017 Ioannis Nompelis

This is the growing collection of my tools for performing calculations that
involve geometry in multiple dimensions. It is meant to be a very lean, fast
and portable library with a very simple API in C/C++ and Fortran.

The library will be receiving updates as I keep revisiting my tools and as I
build new ones in the order that I need them in my work.

Documentation with Doxygen will be included in future updates.
