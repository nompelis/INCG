 INCG v0.1
 A library of essential tools for computational geometry
 Copyright 2017-2019 Ioannis Nompelis

This is the growing collection of my tools for performing calculations that
involve geometry in multiple dimensions. It is meant to be a very lean, fast
and portable library with a very simple API in C/C++ and Fortran.

The library will be receiving updates as I keep revisiting my tools and as I
build new ones in the order that I need them in my work.

Documentation with Doxygen will be included in future updates.
